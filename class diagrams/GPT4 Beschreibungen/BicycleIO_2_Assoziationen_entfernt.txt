The class diagram named `BicycleIO` consists of 13 distinct classes, each representing a different component or concept related to a bicycle system. Here is a detailed description of each class along with their attributes and relationships:\n\n### Classes and their Attributes:\n1. **Energy**:\n   - `double joule`: Represents the kinetic energy in joules.\n\n2. **Light**:\n   - `double lumen`: Measures the light output in lumens.\n\n3. **GearRatio**:\n   - `int teethFront`: Number of teeth on the front gear.\n   - `int teethRear`: Number of teeth on the rear gear.\n\n4. **Rotation**:\n   - `double radian`: Rotation measured in radians.\n\n5. **Crankset**:\n   - No attributes defined. Likely represents the crankset of the bicycle.\n\n6. **Sprocket**:\n   - No attributes defined. Likely represents the sprocket component of the bicycle.\n\n7. **RearWheel**:\n   - No attributes defined. Represents the rear wheel of the bicycle.\n\n8. **FrontWheel**:\n   - No attributes defined. Represents the front wheel of the bicycle.\n\n9. **Dynamo**:\n   - No attributes defined. Represents the dynamo, which typically converts mechanical energy to electrical energy.\n\n10. **Distance**:\n    - `double meter`: Distance measured in meters.\n\n11. **Electricity**:\n    - `double volt`: Electric potential in volts.\n    - `double coulomb`: Electric charge in coulombs.\n\n12. **Lamp**:\n    - `Light out`: An association to the Light class, representing the light output of the lamp.\n\n13. **Bike**:\n    - `Light rearLight`: An association to the Light class, for the bike's rear light.\n    - `Light frontLight`: An association to the Light class, for the bike's front light.\n\n### Associations:\n- The `Light` class, being a component of `Lamp`, `Bike` class (attributes: `rearLight` and `frontLight`), shows the physical application of light properties within these devices.\n\nThe diagram uses these classes to provide a simplified representation of a bicycle system focusing on mechanics (like `GearRatio`, `Crankset`, `Sprocket`, `RearWheel`, `FrontWheel`), electric components (`Dynamo`), and measurements (`Rotation`, `Distance`, `Electricity`). Each class captures a specific characteristic or a suite of functionalities pertinent to the bike s operation.\n\nThe computational or processing aspects between these entities (especially concerning energy conversion, wheel dynamics, or electric generation and utilization) are not specifically modeled with methods or operations in this diagram. It primarily focuses on the structural and property aspects of each component without significant emphasis on interactions or behavioral dynamics, like how energy or electrical outputs are processed or utilized across the system.\n\nThe diagram could potentially be enhanced by detailing the interactions or associations between mechanical components (such as how the `Crankset` influences `RearWheel` via the `Sprocket`), how `Dynamo` interacts with `Electricity`, or modeling how `Lamp` utilizes `Electricity`. However, these associations might have been left intentionally abstract for simplicity or to focus on specific participant details only.
