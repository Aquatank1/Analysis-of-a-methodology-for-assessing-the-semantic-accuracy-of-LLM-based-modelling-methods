This class diagram, named `BicycleIO`, consists of multiple classes that model various aspects and components of a bicycle and associated elements like energy and lighting.\n\n### Total Number of Classes: \nThere are 13 classes in the diagram:\n\n1. Energy\n2. Light\n3. GearRatio\n4. Rotation\n5. Crankset\n6. Sprocket\n7. RearWheel\n8. FrontWheel\n9. Dynamo\n10. Distance\n11. Electricity\n12. Lamp\n13. Bike\n\n### Class Descriptions and Attributes:\n- **Energy**\n  - Attributes:\n    - `kwh` (double): Represents kinetic energy in kilowatt-hours.\n  \n- **Light**\n  - Attributes:\n    - `lumen` (double): Represents the light output measured in lumens.\n  \n- **GearRatio**\n  - Attributes:\n    - `teeth_in_Front` (int): Number of teeth on the front gear.\n    - `teeth_in_Rear` (int): Number of teeth on the rear gear.\n\n- **Rotation**\n  - Attributes:\n    - `degree` (double): Measured rotation in degrees.\n  \n- **Crankset**\n  - No specific attributes.\n  \n- **Sprocket**\n  - No specific attributes.\n  \n- **RearWheel**\n  - No specific attributes.\n  \n- **FrontWheel**\n  - No specific attributes.\n\n- **Dynamo**\n  - Attributes:\n    - `electricity` (Electricity): Instance of Electricity class used to model the electricity generated.\n  \n- **Distance**\n  - Attributes:\n    - `kilometers` (double): Represents the distance traveled in kilometers.\n\n- **Electricity**\n  - Attributes:\n    - `volt` (double): Electrical potential in volts.\n    - `coulomb` (double): Electrical charge in coulombs.\n  \n- **Lamp**\n  - Attributes:\n    - `provided` (Electricity): Electricity provided to the lamp.\n    - `produced` (Light): Light output produced by the lamp.\n  \n- **Bike**\n  - Attributes:\n    - `energy` (Energy): Instance of Energy class modeling the energy of the bike.\n    - `ratio` (GearRatio): Gear ratio configuration.\n    - `drivenDistance` (Distance): Total distance driven by the bike.\n    - `TailLight` and `HeadLight` (Light): Instances of Light class representing the tail light and headlight respectively.\n\n### Associations:\n- The diagram has implied associations (e.g., `Bike` includes instances of `Energy`, `GearRatio`, `Distance`, and `Light`). However, explicit associations (like lines or arrows) between classes are not visually defined in the description provided. The Dynamo class also has an assumption of association with the Electricity class based on attribute type.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis class diagram is detailed and models the functional components of a bicycle along with other relevant environmental and mechanical parameters. Each class is given attributes pertinent to its functionality, providing a robust view of the system as a whole.
