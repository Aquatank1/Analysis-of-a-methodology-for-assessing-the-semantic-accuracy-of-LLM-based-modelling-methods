This class diagram named `BicycleIO` includes a total of 13 defined classes featuring a range of simple data holder entities to slightly more complex ones integrating multiple associations. The diagram defines no explicit relationships such as inheritance or interfaces between classes. Additionally, none of the classes outline methods, focusing solely on properties (attributes). Here is a detailed examination of each class and the attributes they encapsulate:\n\n### Classes:\n\n1. **Crankset**\n   - Contains no attributes.\n\n2. **RearWheel**\n   - Contains no attributes.\n\n3. **Sprocket**\n   - Contains no attributes.\n\n4. **FrontWheel**\n   - Contains no attributes.\n\n5. **Distance**\n   - `+ meter: double` – Represents the distance in meters.\n\n6. **Electricity**\n   - `+ volt: double` – Represents the voltage.\n   - `+ coulomb: double` – Represents the electric charge in coulombs.\n\n7. **Dynamo**\n   - `electricity: Electricity` – Holds an instance of the Electricity class that defines the electrical output.\n\n8. **Lamp**\n   - `+ in: Electricity` – Electric input for the lamp.\n   - `+ out: Light` – Light output of the lamp.\n\n9. **Energy**\n   - `+ joule: double` – Kinetic energy represented in joules.\n\n10. **Light**\n    - `+ lumen: double` – Measure of light output in lumens.\n\n11. **Rotation**\n    - `+ radian: double` – Measures rotation in radians.\n\n12. **GearRatio**\n    - `+ teethFront: int` – Number of teeth on the front gear.\n    - `+ teethRear: int` – Number of teeth on the rear gear.\n\n13. **Bike**\n    - `+ energy: Energy` – An instance of Energy.\n    - `+ ratio: GearRatio` – An instance of GearRatio.\n    - `+ coveredDistance: Distance` – An instance of Distance.\n    - `+ rearLight: Light` – An instance of Light for the rear light.\n    - `+ frontLight: Light` – An instance of Light for the front light.\n\n### Associations and Usage:\n\nThere are no explicit "associations" like aggregations or compositions indicated with connecting lines between classes, but instances of various classes are used as attributes in others, implying relationships. For example:\n\n- **Dynamo** contains an instance of **Electricity**, which implies that Dynamo is dependent on Electricity or potentially generates it.\n- **Lamp** uses **Electricity** as input and produces **Light** as output, describing a typical functional flow in electronic devices.\n- **Bike** integrates multiple instances of other classes, such as **Energy**, **GearRatio**, **Distance**, and **Light** (for both front and rear lights). This aggregation indicates that a Bike consists of these parts or characteristics, providing a comprehensive model of a bicycle's mechanical and electrical systems.\n\nThis diagram provides a succinct yet effective portrayal of the interrelationships inherent in the components of a bicycle, particularly focusing on the input-output aspects concerning energy transformations, mechanical configurations, and resultant functionalities.
