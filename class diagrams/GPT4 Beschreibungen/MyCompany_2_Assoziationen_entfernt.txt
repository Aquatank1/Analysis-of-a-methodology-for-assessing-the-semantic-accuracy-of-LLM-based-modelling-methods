The class diagram named "MyCompany" provides a representation of entities related to a company\'s structure, including types of companies, personnel, and shares. Here is an in-depth description of the diagram:\n\n### Number of Classes and Enumerations\n1. **Enumeration:**\n   - `CorpKind` (enumeration listing types of corporate forms)\n\n2. **Total Classes:**\n   - `Person` (nested within `people` package)\n   - `Address` (nested within `people` package)\n   - `Company`\n   - `Employee` (extends `Person` class from `people` package)\n   - `Share`  \n   \n3. **Total Package:**\n   - `people`\n\n### Classes and Their Attributes\n\n1. **Enumeration: `CorpKind`**\n   - Contains the following values demonstrating different types of corporate structures:\n     - `SOLE_PROPRIETOR`\n     - `S_CORP`\n     - `C_CORP`\n     - `B_CORP`\n     - `CLOSE_CORP`\n     - `NON_PROFIT`\n\n2. **Package: `people`**\n   - Contains classes related to individuals:\n   \n   - **Class: `Person`**\n     - `birthday`: A `Date` attribute representing the birth date of a person.\n     - `nickNames`: A `List<String>` holding various nicknames for the person.\n   \n   - **Class: `Address`**\n     - `city`: A `String` representing the city part of an address.\n     - `street`: A `String` detailing the street name.\n     - `number`: An `int` representing the street number.\n    \n3. **Class: `Company`**\n   - Inherits from `Entity` (not described in the excerpt provided).\n   - `kind`: An attribute of type `CorpKind`, indicating the type of the company according to the enumerated types.\n\n4. **Class: `Employee`**\n   - Inherits from `Person`, gaining the attributes `birthday` and `nickNames` in addition to its specific attribute:\n   - `salary`: An `int` representing the employee s salary.\n\n5. **Class: `Share`**\n   - `value`: An `int` which presumably represents the monetary value of a share.\n\n### Associations\n\n- **Company and Employee**\n  - A bidirectional association resembling an employment relationship:\n    - Notation: `[2..*] Company (employer) <-> Employee [*]`\n    - This indicates that each `Company` (as an employer) can have multiple `Employee` objects (at least 2 due to `2..*`), and an `Employee` can be associated with multiple `Company` objects (indicated by `*`).\n\nIn summary, the "MyCompany" class diagram encapsulates the structure of a company through various classes representing individuals (employees), types of companies, and values vested as shares. The use of an enumeration for corporate types and the association depicting employment relationships highlight both the structural and relational aspects of the diagram. The diagram also uses inheritance effectively between `Person` and `Employee` to reuse and extend attributes.
