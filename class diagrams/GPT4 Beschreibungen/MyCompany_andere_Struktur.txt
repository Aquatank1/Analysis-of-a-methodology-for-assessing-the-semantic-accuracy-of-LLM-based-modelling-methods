This class diagram represents a simplified model of a company structure named "MyCompany." It defines associations and hierarchies among various entities such as people and companies. The diagram includes different elements as described:\n\n### Classes and Interfaces:\n\n1. **CorpKind (Enum)**\n   - It defines the types of corporations: `SOLE_PROPRIETOR`, `S_CORP`, `C_CORP`, `B_CORP`, `CLOSE_CORP`, `NON_PROFIT`.\n\n2. **entity (Interface)**\n   - The base interface which is implemented by classes `Person` and `Company`.\n\n3. **Person (Class)**\n   - Inherits from the `Entity` interface.\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `birthday`: Date on which the person was born.\n     - `nickNames`: A list of strings representing the nicknames.\n     - `salary`: Integer representing the person\'s salary.\n\n4. **Address (Class)**\n   - This class is standalone within the current model context.\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `city`: String representing the city part of the address.\n     - `street`: String representing the street part of the address.\n     - `number`: Integer representing the building number.\n\n5. **Employee (Class)**\n   - Inherits from `Person` but does not add any new attributes or methods. Represents an employee who is a type of person with a specified role within a company.\n\n6. **Share (Class)**\n   - Represents a share in a company.\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `value`: Integer representing the monetary value of the share.\n\n7. **Company (Class)**\n   - Implements the `Entity` interface.\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `kind`: A variable of type `CorpKind`, representing the kind of corporation.\n     - `shares`: A list containing objects of the `Share` class, representing shares owned by the company.\n     - `employees`: A list containing objects of the `Employee` class, representing individuals employed by the company.\n\n### Association:\n\n- **shareholding**\n  - This is an association between the `Entity` interface and the `Share` class.\n  - Multiplicity:\n    - **Entity (shareholder)**: Each shareholder (an instance of an entity) is linked with minimum 1 Share.\n    - **Share (owns)**: Each share is owned by between 7 to 9478 shareholders.\n\nEach class is represented with its members, i.e., attributes, and shows inheritance where applicable. The classes are coupled with associations indicating meaningful relationships to determine ownership of shares by entities. This organization helps in realizing a structured approach to model the basic operations or structure of a company in terms of personnel and asset management.
