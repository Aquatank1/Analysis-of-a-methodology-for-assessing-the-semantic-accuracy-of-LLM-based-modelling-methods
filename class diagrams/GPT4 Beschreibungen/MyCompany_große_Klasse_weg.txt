Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Enumeration\n- **CorpKind**: An enum with the following values indicating the type of corporation:\n  - SOLE_PROPRIETOR\n  - S_CORP\n  - C_CORP\n  - B_CORP\n  - CLOSE_CORP\n  - NON_PROFIT\n\n### Classes\n1. **Entity** (implied base class, utilized by other classes for common properties like identification, but specifics are not provided in the diagram).\n2. **Person**:\n   - This class is part of the `people` package.\n   - Attributes:\n     - **birthday**: Stores the birthdate. Type is `Date`.\n     - **nickNames**: A list of strings holding various nicknames. Type is `List<String>`.\n   - Inherits from the `Entity` class.\n3. **Company**:\n   - Attributes:\n     - **kind**: Type of corporation, specified by `CorpKind`.\n   - Inherits from the `Entity` class.\n4. **Employee**:\n   - Attributes:\n     - **salary**: Numeric value indicating employee s salary.
