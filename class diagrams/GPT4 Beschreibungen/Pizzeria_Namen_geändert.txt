The class diagram titled "PizzeriaData" consists of multiple class and enum declarations, primarily focused on modeling a pizzeria environment including the essential components for constructing a pizza, placing an order, and handling the billing aspect.\n\n### Classes and Enumerations within the Diagram:\n- **Total number of classes**: 8\n- **Total number of enums**: 2\n\n### Class Descriptions:\n\n1. **Component**:\n   - Attributes:\n     - `quantity`: Integer representing the quantity of the component.\n   - This class serves as a base class for various pizza components with a shared attribute, `quantity`.\n\n2. **Cheese** (extends Component):\n   - Constructor to initialize Cheese related attributes, inherits quantity.\n\n3. **Dough** (extends Component):\n   - Constructor to initialize Dough related attributes, inherits quantity.\n\n4. **Sauce** (extends Component):\n   - Constructor to initialize Sauce related attributes, inherits quantity.\n\n5. **Salami** (extends Component):\n   - Constructor to initialize Salami related attributes, inherits quantity.\n\n6. **Flour** (extends Component):\n   - Constructor to initialize Flour related attributes, inherits quantity.\n\n7. **Pizza**:\n   - Attributes:\n     - `cheese`: Instance of Cheese class.\n     - `dough`: Instance of Dough class.\n     - `sauce`: Instance of Sauce class.\n     - `salami`: Instance of Salami class.\n     - `baked`: Boolean representing if the pizza has been baked.\n     - `type`: Enum of type PizzaType.\n     - `diameter`: Enum of type Diameter.\n\n8. **Order**:\n   - Attributes:\n     - `type`: Enum of type PizzaType indicating the type of pizza.\n     - `diameter`: Enum of type Diameter specifying the size of the pizza.\n     \n9. **Bill**:\n   - Attributes:\n     - `costs`: Integer representing the total cost of the order.\n\n### Enum Descriptions:\n\n1. **PizzaType**:\n   - Values:\n     - `MARGHERITA`\n     - `SALAMI`\n   - Represents different types of pizzas available.\n\n2. **Diameter**:\n   - Values:\n     - `SMALL`\n     - `LARGE`\n   - Represents different sizes of pizzas available.\n\n### Associations:\n\n- The `Pizza` class has associations with the `Cheese`, `Dough`, `Sauce`, `Salami` classes, and uses the `PizzaType` and `Diameter` enums to represent the configuration of a pizza.\n- The `Order` class uses the `PizzaType` and `Diameter` enums to specify what type and size of pizza is being ordered.\n- No explicit associations with the `Bill` class, but implied usage through the ordering process to calculate costs based on other class attributes.\n\nThis structure effectively encapsulates various entities involved in a pizzeria\'s operation from crafting the key ingredients to ordering, cooking, and billing a pizza, using OOP principles of inheritance and composition.
