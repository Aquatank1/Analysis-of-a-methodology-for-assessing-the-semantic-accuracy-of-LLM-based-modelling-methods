The class diagram `PizzeriaData` comprises seven classes and two enumerations. Below is a detailed description of each component in the diagram:\n\n### Enumerations:\n1. **`PizzaKind`**:\n   - Enumerates the type of pizzas available: `MARGHERITA` and `SALAMI`.\n\n2. **`Size`**:\n   - Enumerates the sizes in which the pizza can be ordered: `SMALL` and `LARGE`.\n\n### Classes:\n1. **`Pizza`**:\n   - Represents a pizza with the following attributes:\n     - `Dough dough`: Represents the dough of the pizza.\n     - `TomatoSauce tomatoSauce`: Tomato sauce used on the pizza.\n     - `Cheese cheese`: Cheese used on the pizza.\n     - `Salami salami`: Salami used on the pizza, applicable for pizzas like Salami.\n     - `boolean baked`: Indicates if the pizza has been baked.\n     - `PizzaKind kind`: The kind of pizza, as defined in `PizzaKind`.\n     - `Size size`: The size of the pizza, as defined in `Size`.\n\n2. **`Bill`**:\n   - Represents a bill with the following attribute:\n     - `int price`: The monetary cost on the bill.\n\n3. **`Order`**:\n   - Represents an order with the following attributes:\n     - `PizzaKind kind`: The kind of pizza being ordered.\n     - `Size size`: The size of the pizza being ordered.\n\n4. **`Ingredient`** (spelled as `Incredient` in your diagram that seems to be a typo):\n   - Represents the base class for all ingredients with the following attribute:\n     - `int quantity`: Quantity of the ingredient.\n\n5. **`Cheese`**:\n   - Subclass of `Ingredient` that represents cheese. It doesn't introduce any new attributes.\n\n6. **`Dough`**:\n   - Subclass of `Ingredient` that represents dough. It doesn't introduce any new attributes.\n\n7. **`TomatoSauce`**:\n   - Subclass of `Ingredient` that represents tomato sauce. It doesn't introduce any new attributes.\n\n8.  **`Flour`**:\n   - Subclass of `Ingredient` that represents flour. It doesn't introduce any new attributes.\n\n9. **`Salami`**:\n   - Subclass of `Ingredient` that represents salami. It doesn't introduce any new attributes.\n\n### Associations:\nThe diagram indicates compositional relationships between classes, suggesting the following:\n- **`Pizza`** consists of `Dough`, `TomatoSauce`, `Cheese`, and optionally `Salami`, depending on the pizza kind (`kind`). \n- **`Order`** specifies what kind of `Pizza` is being ordered using the attributes `kind` and `size` from the `PizzaKind` and `Size` enumerations but no direct compositional connection is shown in your description, suggesting it s handled potentially elsewhere (like a pizzeria business logic class not shown in the diagram).\n- **`Bill`** seems to be standalone with only `int price` attribute but lacks direct connections to `Orders` or `Pizzas`, implying there's potentially an external management system or method handling the computation of prices and bill generation based on the orders.\n\nThe description of the classes also alludes to constructors and potential usage in specific computation contexts (MontiArc), which suggests specialized behavior or lifecycle management within the pizzeria application's architecture. However, details about behavior, methods, or deeper functionality (beyond constructor declarations) are not shown in the provided description.
