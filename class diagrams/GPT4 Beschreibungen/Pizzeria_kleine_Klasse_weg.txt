This class diagram, titled “PizzeriaData”, illustrates the classes and their relationships in a pizzeria interface system. Here is a detailed description of its various components:\n\n### Total Number of Classes:\n- **6 concrete classes**: Ingredient, Cheese, Dough, TomatoSauce, Flour, Pizza, Bill\n- **2 enumeration classes**: PizzaKind, Size\n\n### Associations:\n- **Inheritance**: Cheese, Dough, TomatoSauce, and Flour extend from the base class Ingredient.\n- **Composition**: Pizza class contains objects of types Cheese, Dough, TomatoSauce, and implicitly has an association with Salami.\n\n### Description of Each Class and Their Attributes:\n#### 1. **Ingredient** (base class)\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `int quantity`: Represents the quantity of the ingredient.\n\n#### 2. **Cheese** (derives from Ingredient)\n   - **Constructors**:\n     - `Cheese()`: Initializes an instance of Cheese.\n\n#### 3. **Dough** (derives from Ingredient)\n   - **Constructors**:\n     - `Dough()`: Initializes an instance of Dough.\n\n#### 4. **TomatoSauce** (derives from Ingredient)\n   - **Constructors**:\n     - `TomatoSauce()`: Initializes an instance of TomatoSauce.\n\n#### 5. **Flour** (derives from Ingredient)\n   - **Constructors**:\n     - `Flour()`: Initializes an instance of Flour.\n\n#### 6. **Pizza**\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `Cheese cheese`: Component of pizza specifying the cheese used.\n     - `Dough dough`: Component of pizza specifying the dough used.\n     - `TomatoSauce tomatoSauce`: Component of pizza specifying the tomato sauce used.\n     - `Salami salami`: Component of pizza specifying the salami used (Implied to exist).\n     - `bool baked`: Status to check if the pizza is baked.\n     - `PizzaKind kind`: Enum indicating the type of pizza.\n     - `Size size`: Enum indicating the size of the pizza.\n\n#### 7. **Bill**\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `int price`: Indicates the price on the bill.\n\n### Enumeration Classes:\n#### **PizzaKind**\n   - **Values**:\n     - `MARGHERITA`: Represents Margherita type pizza.\n     - `SALAMI`: Represents Salami type pizza.\n   \n#### **Size**\n   - **Values**:\n     - `SMALL`: Represents a small-sized pizza.\n     - `LARGE`: Represents a large-sized pizza.\n\n### Summary:\nThe class diagram for the PizzeriaData provides a structural representation of the classes involved in managing different components of pizzas, including their ingredients and related attributes like size and type. The system facilitates operations such as preparing pizzas with specific ingredients, pricing them, and marking pizza baking status. The use of inheritance for ingredient-related classes allows for a structured and organized code, capable of extending to more ingredients efficiently.
